# Burger

Burger is an application that allows the user to create and 'devour' burgers. Creating a burger will insert the burger into the database with a devoured default boolean value of false. Choosing to 'devour it' shows that the burger has been eaten, and the devoured boolean value within the database is changed from false to true. This application follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
